## License (no, seriously)
Not licensed (yet! whoops)

May be licensed with GNU GPL v3. Or in the public domain. I don't know, honestly!

## What is this datapack for?
Testing with Minecraft. /give, /effect, /entitydata, you name it. Plus other useful stuff for servers (probably).

## Maintainers
Current maintainers of this project are:
- @UnderSet (former repository owner)

## Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Why make a Minecraft datapack instead of a Forge/Fabric mod?

A: I don't know enough Java and also because making a mod can break Minecraft to unplayable levels (or even unlaunchable too!).

Q: Where's the code?

A: I am making it. Be patient (seriously).
